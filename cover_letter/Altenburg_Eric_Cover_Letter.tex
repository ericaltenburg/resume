\lettercontent{Dear Recruitment Team,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{
Looking at how Oscar Health sets itself apart from health insurance speaks to me as I believe technology plays a vital role in helping to maintain our health today. Creating something that will have a positive impact on those around me are vital to my core beliefs, and after I was introduced to the role of a data and systems software engineer by Hamzah Nizami—a current software engineering intern—I knew this would be a way of transferring those beliefs into technology.
}


   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{While completing my degree, I have taken and helped teach several classes such as Algorithms, Creative Problem Solving \& Team Programming, Agile Methods for Software Development, and the Fundamentals of Programming Languages. All of which have allowed me to hone my skills as a programmer to work towards solutions to complex problems with teams of varying sizes while using different software development strategies.}

\lettercontent{Aside from academics, I worked on a team as an undergraduate researcher at Texas State University to help further Dr. Quijin Gu's project of predicting UAV batter consumption pre-flight. Doing this type of work exposed me to the process of risk analysis and taking lead on projects to explore other areas where a solution may be found.}

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

\lettercontent{With this, I believe all of these past experiences will make me a strong addition to the teams at Oscar Health. I am confident in my ability to meet the requirements of creating healthcare solutions, and I look forward to the challenges ahead. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application.}
